II- Extractive methods approachs

	1) Construct an intermediate representation of the input text which expresses the main aspects of the text.
		a) topic representation:
			Concept : 
				text --> intermediate representation --> interpret the topic --> produce a summary
			Methods :
				* frequency-driven approaches:
					word probability
					Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF)
				* topic word approaches :
					frequency thresholds
					log-likelihood ratio test to identify explanatory words (topic signature)
					compute the importance of a sentence : 
						1- function of the number of topic signatures it contains
						2- theproportion of the topic signatures in the sentence
				* latent semantic analysis
				* Bayesian topic models

			Interpret the topic in practice :  assign an importance score to each sentence (the score is computed by aggregating the evidence from different indicator)

			produce a summary in practice : summarizer system selects the top k most important sentences to produce a summary (greedy algorithms or  convert the selection of sentences into an optimization problem)
			
		b) indicator representation

	2) Score the sentences based on the representation.
	3) select a summary comprising of a number of sentences.
